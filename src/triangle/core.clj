;; Love Triangle #127
;;
;; Difficulty:	Hard
;; Topics:	search data-analysis
;;
;;
;; Everyone loves triangles, and it's easy to understand why they're so wonderfully symmetric
;; (except scalenes, they suck).
;;
;; Your passion for triangles has led you to become a miner (and part-time Clojure programmer)
;; where you work all day to chip out isosceles-shaped minerals from rocks gathered in a nearby
;; open-pit mine. There are too many rocks coming from the mine to harvest them all so you've been
;; tasked with writing a program to analyze the mineral patterns of each rock, and determine which
;; rocks have the biggest minerals.
;;
;; Someone has already written a computer-vision system for the mine. It images each rock as it
;; comes into the processing centre and creates a cross-sectional bitmap of mineral (1) and
;; rock (0) concentrations for each one.
;;
;; You must now create a function which accepts a collection of integers, each integer when read
;; in base-2 gives the bit-representation of the rock (again, 1s are mineral and 0s are worthless
;; scalene-like rock).
;;
;; You must return the cross-sectional area of the largest harvestable mineral from the input rock,
;; as follows:
;; - The minerals only have smooth faces when sheared vertically or horizontally from the rock's
;;   cross-section
;; - The mine is only concerned with harvesting isosceles triangles (such that one or two sides
;;   an be sheared)
;; - If only one face of the mineral is sheared, its opposing vertex must be a point
;;   (ie. the smooth face must be of odd length), and its two equal-length sides must intersect
;;   the shear face at 45Â° (ie. those sides must cut even-diagonally)
;; - The harvested mineral may not contain any traces of rock
;; - The mineral may lie in any orientation in the plane
;; - Area should be calculated as the sum of 1s that comprise the mineral
;; - Minerals must have a minimum of three measures of area to be harvested
;; - If no minerals can be harvested from the rock, your function should return nil
